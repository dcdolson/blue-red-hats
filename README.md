# blue-red-hats
Working on a puzzle by simulation. Playing with C++ futures, threads, and enum classes.

the riddle is:  100 prisoners are lined up single file. A blue or red hat is placed on each of their heads randomly.
They cannot see the colour of their own hat, but they can see all the hats in front of them (e,g,. the prisoner in the
back can clearly see all 99 hats in front of him). A guard is going to walk down the line, starting in the back, and
ask each prisoner what color hat they have on. They can only answer "blue" or "red." If they answer incorrectly, or
say anything else, they will be shot dead on the spot. If they answer correctly, they will be set free.  Each prisoner
can hear all of the other prisoners' responses, as well as any gunshots that indicate an incorrect response. Before the
executions begin, the prisoners get to huddle up and make a plan.  
How can the prisoners ensure that the most people possible survive?
